            Please use conventional commit format:
            
            - feat: A new feature
            - fix: A bug fix
            - docs: Documentation only changes
            - style: Changes that don't affect code meaning
            - refactor: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
            - perf: Performance improvement
            - test: Adding missing tests
            - chore: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools
            
            Example: "feat: add new todo list filter"
            
            For breaking changes, add ! after type or include "BREAKING CHANGE" in commit body.
